        <h2>What is Express Entry?</h2>
        <p>Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage applications for permanent residence from skilled workers. It covers three main programs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Federal Skilled Worker Program:</strong> For skilled workers with foreign work experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Federal Skilled Trades Program:</strong> For skilled workers in specific trades.</li>
            <li><strong>Canadian Experience Class:</strong> For skilled workers who have Canadian work experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Improve Your CRS Score?</h3>
        <p>If your score is lower than the recent cut-offs, consider these strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improve Language Scores:</strong> Retaking IELTS or CELPIP to reach CLB 9 or 10 can significantly boost your score.</li>
            <li><strong>Provincial Nominee Program (PNP):</strong> A nomination from a province gives you an automatic 600 points.</li>
            <li><strong>Gain Work Experience:</strong> Additional years of skilled work experience, especially in Canada, will add points.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Education:</strong> Completing a Master's or PhD can provide more points for human capital.</li>
        </ul>
